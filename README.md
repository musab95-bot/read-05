CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box is presented. 

A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to in HTML and declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.


CSS consists of CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value.

and finally, different selectors were introduced. 
-universel seletor
-type selctor
-class selctor
-ID selctor
-child selctor
-descendent selector
-adjacent sbiling selector
-gneneral sbiling selector

and finally, it was concluded that CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
